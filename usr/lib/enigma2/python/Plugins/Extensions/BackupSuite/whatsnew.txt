Changelog
=========
Git 86   20-12-2015
Did some overdue maintenance on plugin.py concerning the VU+ models

Git 85   13-12-2015
Added support for the VU+ Solo 4K. Beware: this is a very early test, the plugin still needs some tidying up.
Don't try to flash the made back-up of the Solo 4k with the built in OFGWRITE, it needs an update to be able to flash the Solo 4K
Reverted the truncating of the kernelpartition

Git 84   06-12-2015
Added seasons greetings

Git 83   30-11-2015
Added support for the Xsarius Fusion HD SE
Corrected the extra path for the Xsarius HD

Git 82   14-11-2015
Completed support for the Xsarius Fusion HD (at the moment still no confirmation if it functions), looking for some owners of a Fusion who would like to test it and report if all is functioning as it should.
Removed the support for unknown devices.

Git 81   10-11-2015
Added support for Xsarius Fusion HD (very experimental, use with care!)

Git 80   25-10-2015
Temporary measure: bail out if the receiver is a VU+ Solo 4K until more is known what the requirements are to make a working back-up
Lookuptable expanded with the entry Solo4K

Git 78 & 79
Git 78 has been canceled/reverted by Git 79

Git 77   27-09-2015
Removed some obsolete code, this were some remains of experiments which I overlooked

Git 76   25-09-2015
Made some alterations in the way a back-up is made: if a backup is made onto the harddisk there is no longer a flashable copy made in the root of the harddisk. The backup is only stored in the folder "fullbackup_<type> etc.
If the backup is made onto an USB-stick then the copy is made in the root and a copy in the folder fullbackup_<type> etc.

Git 75   25-07-2015
Very small change in handling/reporting unknown device

Git 74   24-07-2015
Very small change in selecting the correct model from the list

Git 73   23-07-2015
Added some kind of support for unknown receivers. If the receiver is not found in the lookuptable the program won't be aborted but a backup will be made with some standard file naming. The user has at least to rename the folder where the backup is made.
Highly experimental but it is worth a go.
WTE gave me the idea to read some necessities from the receiver. Thanks!

Git 72   28-06-2015
Some small alterations in the way the kernel is dumped, after dumping it will truncated to it's true size
Inspired by the code of Athoik as seen in: http://tinyurl.com/ofmcvuo
Thanks!

Git 71   24-06-2015
Openmb added support for the Miraclebox Mini plus and Micro

Git 67   06-06-2015
Some small alterations

Git 64   12-02-2015
Added support for the HD 500c

Git 63   09-02-2015
Russian translation improved (thanks to 2boom)

Git 62   01-02-2015
Added support for the HD 1200

Git 61   28-01-2015
Replaced the help and info buttons

Git 60   23-01-2015
Some fine tuning for the full HD skins

Git 59   21-01-2015
A first step to make the BackupSuite also useable on full HD format skins (1920*1080). 
There still has to be done some work but because of the experimental stage of the full HD skin this has, for me, a low priority at the moment.

Git 58   18-01-2015
- Some minor changes in the code (some inspired by code of Athoik)
- Some cosmetics in the lookuptable
